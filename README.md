CoinGecko API has been used to get all important datas about HPB.

### High Performance Blockchain Overview

High Performance Blockchain (HPB) is a revolutionary permissionless blockchain architecture that combines a customized hardware Blockchain Offload Engine (BOE), with high-performance blockchain software. The addition of a hardware based BOE, allows for high transaction speed and extremely low latency.
Despite high-performance, there is no compromise in terms of security and decentralization, as the Node network verifies transactions worldwide and is comprised of a dual election mechanism combining the best aspects of voting and delegation.
As a permissionless blockchain, anyone can deploy smart contracts, contribute data or use the blockchain. It is our goal to enable and empower as many individuals and enterprises worldwide and build HPBâ€™s DApp ecosystem tailored for enterprise applications.
