# QNT Price Simulator


**QNT Price Simulator** is a project build under Node.js , JavaScript (mainly ES6), HTML5 /CSS3 and Bootstrap 4 framework.
Particles.js has been implanted to apply a dynamic and modern background made of particles.
AutoNumeric.js has been added to format correctly numbers inside inputs (thousand separators ...)
CoinGecko API has been used to get all important datas about QNT.

### Quant Network Overview

OverLedger = The first inter-operable blockchain operating system that facilitates the internet-scale development of decentralised multi-chains applications.
Overledger is NOT another blockchain, it’s the “Overledger” that sits on top of blockchains providing a meta-gateway
Problem it solves: The major limitation of modern day blockchain is the inability of blockchains to communicate with one another. Example: why can’t a smart contract executed on Ethereum be recognised by the Hyperledger blockchain?
OverLedger is focusing on three goals:
1. Developing an interface to connect the world’s networks to multiple blockchains.
2. Bridging existing networks (e.g. financial services) to new blockchains.
3. Developing a new blockchain operating system with a protocol and a platform to allow developers to easily create next-generation, multi-chain applications.

#### Purposes of QNT Price Simulator App

The main purpose of this application is to provide detailed and constantly updated information to QNT investors.
This app provides you a lot of essential data, refreshed every second :

- Current Price in USD
- Current Price in BTC
- Current MarketCap in USD
- Current circulating supply
- USD Value change in 24 Hours
- BTC Value change in 24 Hours
- All Time High in BTC
- All Time High in USD
- Volume in USD in last 24 Hours
- Current Market cap Rank

The second purpose of QNT Price Simulator is to simulate the future price of QNT Token.
The user has the possibility to enter the future expected marketCap of QNT, the future circulating supply
of QNT and the number of QNT Tokens in his portfolio.
A result will be displayed at the bottom of the App when the user clicks on "Calculate Price" button.

This personnal project highlights the tremendous financial potential of Quant Network.

A lot of improvements will be added soon ( like required inputs for example ) and the app will be rebuild under React.js soon.
